### This Tutorial Only Works on Android OS

Since Solana Mobile SDK hasn't support iOS yet. You can't connect wallet with [@solana/mobile-wallet-adapter](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter) on iOS devices. As a result, this tutorial only works on Android right now.

### Setting up the development environment

There are two ways to develop React Native App.
- Expo Go
- React Native CLI

We don't talk about which one is better here. The point is I have tried to run this code with Expo Go. However it still has some issues when using [@solana/mobile-wallet-adapter](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter), but it works fine with React Native CLI.

So I suggest you to use React Native CLI method to setting up your development environment.

Follow this [doc](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to setup.

### Creat a Pixel 4 Android virtual device

### Install `metaplex-candy-machine`
- https://github.com/BoxInThePARK/metaplex-candy-machine
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BoxInThePARK/metaplex-candy-machine.git

$ cd metaplex-candy-machine
$ pnpm install
```

### Install `mobile-nft-mint-example`
- https://github.com/BoxInThePARK/mobile-nft-mint-example
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BoxInThePARK/mobile-nft-mint-example.git

$ cd mobile-nft-mint-example
$ yarn
```

### Step Arweave Wallet

Follow this [doc](https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/arweave-web-extension-wallet) to setup your Arweave wallet and claim free AR token by completing assigned [task](https://faucet.arweave.net/).
**You should have a downloaded key file after the setup.** We will need the keyfile in the rest of the tutorial.

## Part 1: Create Candy Machine

## Part 2: Run The App on Android Emulator/Device

### Setup Arweave Wallet
Follow this [doc](https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/arweave-web-extension-wallet) to setup your Arweave wallet and claim free AR token by completing assigned task.

### Setup Minter Wallet (if needs)
To initialize metaple js, you need to set an identity.
There are two functions to let you set the identity.
- walletIdentity()
